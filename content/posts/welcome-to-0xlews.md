# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Lewis. I work in security, incident Response, and other general research at Microsoft and I'm based in the UK.

Outside of work, I often climb boulders, stay active in the gym, badly play golf and going off piste.

## What to Expect

This blog will range between topics:

- Technical write-ups
- Malware analysis and research
- LLMs
- Tool building
- Kusto!
- Other research

## Recent Projects

I enjoy building little tools that effectively solve problems I encounter and expect others might too. One old project if you haven't seen is **Virus.xcheck**, a Python tool for checking file hashes against the Virus Exchange database.
